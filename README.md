## About Me
Hi, I’m **Amr Zakariya**—a senior computer-science student who treats infrastructure as code and delivery as a pipeline.  
My daily toolkit: **AWS CloudFormation · Docker · GitHub Actions · CloudWatch · Kubernetes**.

### What I’m building
- **Serverless URL shortener** on AWS SAM (API Gateway | Lambda | DynamoDB) with automated deploys and alerting.
- **Modern portfolio site** containerized with multi-stage Docker builds and shipped via Render.

### Interests
Cloud automation · Secure CI/CD · Observability · SRE culture · Open source collaboration.
